# Multiview Orthographic Feature Transformation for 3D Object Detection
 Multiview 3D object detection on MultiviewC dataset through moft3d.

## Introduction
We propose a novel method, MOFT3D, for multiview 3D object detection and MultiviewC, a synthetic dataset, for multi-view detection in occlusion scenarios.
